## How to Use
There is a release binary file in the `x64/Realse` folder. Run it to use. The interaction of software is based on command line. You can type in `help;` command for more details. 

The `Script List` widget in the menu bar includes some off-the-shelf scripts with their titles, descriptions and contents. If you don't know how to use a command, search the examples in scripts.

For some reason, you should restart software to run another script if you have run one before.
